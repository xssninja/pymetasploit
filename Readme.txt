Thanks to allfro and Mikaayenson for the Pymetasploit library and the bug fix to the attribute issue made by Mikaayenson which echoed the fix I made when I got stuck with the same error. Being somewhat of a python noob, I'm retiring my patch and forking Mikaayenson to have a "working" version available for HackerMode2 going forward.
It it my intention to add to the library over time but to keep it compatible with HackerMode2 and later versions if they continue to rely on this library.
